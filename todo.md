  4. FULL OUTER JOINs: Complete view of users and their tasks
  5. Self JOINs: Find task dependencies (tasks that depend on
  other tasks)
  6. Multiple JOINs: Get task details with user, category, and
  project info
  7. Subqueries: Find users with more than 5 overdue tasks
  8. CASE statements: Categorize task priority levels
  9. Window functions: Rank users by task completion rate
  10. GROUP BY with HAVING: Teams with average task completion
